        Young Researchers Forum (YRF 2025) is part of CALDAM Pre-Conference
        School and is the third in the series of CALDAM conferences. YRF is a
        unique opportunity as an open discussion session for ambitious young
        researchers to present a problem they are attempting to solve in the
        conference theme and to receive feedback from participating peers and
        eminent researchers. YRF provides a friendly environment for young
        researchers to foster research. An interactive session of this kind
        enables students, researchers, and teachers to engage in the exchange of
        knowledge, ideas, and research methods that benefit all participants of
        the Pre-Conference School. YRF will be taking place on Day 1 of CALDAM
        Pre-Conference School.
