          Young Researchers Forum (YRF 2025) is part of CALDAM Pre-Conference
          School and is the third in the series of CALDAM conferences. YRF is a
          unique opportunity as an open discussion session for ambitious young
          researchers to present a problem they are attempting to solve in the
          conference theme and to receive feedback from participating peers and
          eminent researchers. YRF provides a friendly environment for young
          researchers to foster research. An interactive session of this kind
          enables students, researchers, and teachers to engage in the exchange
          of knowledge, ideas, and research methods that benefit all
          participants of the Pre-Conference School. YRF will be taking place on
          Day 1 (10th Feb,2025) of CALDAM Pre-Conference School.
